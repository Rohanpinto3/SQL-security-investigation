SQL Security Investigation Project

This project examines suspicious login activity and employee machine data using SQL filtering techniques.
I worked with two datasets — employees and log_in_attempts — to investigate possible security incidents inside a large organization.

Project Includes

SQL queries using AND, OR, NOT, and LIKE

Filtering for specific dates and times

Identifying suspicious login behavior

Finding employees in specific departments or buildings

Excluding certain conditions using NOT

🧠 Skills Demonstrated

SQL filtering (AND, OR, NOT)

Pattern matching with LIKE

Time-based filtering

Date range filtering

Basic incident investigation logic

Data validation & verification

📌 Scenario Summary

In this investigation, I analyzed:

Failed login attempts after business hours

Login activity on specific suspicious dates

Login attempts outside Mexico

Employees in Marketing offices located in the East building

Employees in Finance or Sales departments

Employees in all departments except Information Technology

These tasks simulate common investigative steps a SOC analyst performs when reviewing suspicious activity.
